1) print function
print keyword in Python 2.x is replaced by the print() function in Python 3.x. However,
parentheses work in Python 2 if space is added after the print keyword because the interpreter evaluates it as an expression. 

print 'Hello, Geeks'	 # Python 3.x doesn't support

print('Hope You like these facts')



'''

Output in Python 2.x :

Hello, Geeks

Hope You like these facts



Output in Python 3.x :

File "a.py", line 1

	print 'Hello, Geeks'
